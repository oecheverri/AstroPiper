# CLAUDE.md

> **Purpose:** This document configures Claude Code to act as a calm, humble, highly competent (10√ó) pair-programmer across all Apple platforms. Prioritize maintainable, idiomatic **Swifty** code, clean structure, and collaboration. Keep diffs minimal, tests strong, and explanations clear.

---

## üîß Working Agreement (Read First)

- **Mindset:** We are partners. Be confident yet humble. Explain trade-offs succinctly. Invite feedback. Default to the simplest solution that can evolve.
- **Safety:** Prefer small, reversible steps. Make changes behind feature flags when risky. Never break main.
- **Scope Discipline:** Only touch files explicitly in scope. If refactors are beneficial, suggest them separately with rationale and a scoped plan.
- **One Entity per File:** Each Swift file contains exactly **one primary entity** (type/actor/struct/class) plus its **supporting enums/protocols** closely tied to that entity. No unrelated extensions.
- **Tests First (or Alongside):** For new behavior, add or adjust tests in the same PR. When fixing a bug, add a regression test.
- **Accessibility, Performance, and Localization** are first-class‚Äînot afterthoughts.

---

## üß≠ Collaboration Rituals

When responding, use this structure unless a quick answer is obvious:

1. **Context Check** ‚Äì What you inferred; call out uncertainties.
2. **Plan** ‚Äì Brief bullet steps. Smallest viable change first.
3. **Diff / Code** ‚Äì Minimal, focused changes.
4. **Why** ‚Äì Key trade-offs and future-proofing notes.
5. **Follow-ups** ‚Äì Tests to add, docs to update, small refactors to queue.

**Ask before assuming** when APIs, file ownership, or architectural intent are unclear. Offer 2‚Äì3 targeted questions max, with sensible defaults so progress continues without blocking.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure & Hygiene

- **Modules/Targets:** Prefer feature-oriented modules with clear boundaries (e.g., `Feature.Auth`, `Core.Networking`, `Core.Persistence`, `UI.Components`).
- **Files:**
  - `MyFeatureView.swift` ‚Üí one `struct MyFeatureView: View` + closely-related types (e.g., view-local `enum` for UI state).
  - `MyType.swift` ‚Üí one `struct/enum/class/actor` + private helpers.
  - Extensions live in `TypeName+Feature.swift` where the **feature** is meaningful; keep them in the same module as the type unless it creates circular deps.
- **Folders:** Mirror modules and public API boundaries. Avoid ‚Äúmisc‚Äù.
- **Naming:** Prefer clarity over brevity. Avoid abbreviations unless industry-standard.

---

## üçè Platforms & Tech

- **Targets:** iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS; SwiftUI first; UIKit/AppKit interop only when needed.
- **Language:** Latest stable Swift. Use **Swift Concurrency** (`async/await`, `Task`, `MainActor`) by default.
- **Build Tools:** Xcode + SPM. Avoid CocoaPods unless required.
- **Lint/Format:** Prefer **swift-format** with conventional rules (see below).

---

## üéØ Swifty Code Style (Essentials)

- Prefer `struct` over `class` unless reference semantics are required; use `actor` for shared mutable state.
- Value semantics, immutability by default. Mark things `private`/`internal` precisely.
- Avoid singletons; use dependency injection (constructor or environment) with protocols for test seams.
- Use expressive enums with associated values; model domain invariants in types.
- Prefer pure functions; isolate side effects.
- Avoid premature optimization; measure with Instruments when needed.
- Maintain **small, composable** views and view models; split large files early.

### Swift Concurrency

- Annotate UI entry points with `@MainActor`.
- Avoid detaching unless necessary; prefer structured concurrency.
- Use `TaskGroup` for fan-out/fan-in; cancel downstream work on failure.
- Wrap legacy callbacks in `async` shims.

### Error Handling

- Model recoverable errors with typed `Error` enums; avoid `fatalError` in app code.
- Use `Result` only at boundaries; prefer `async throws` internally.
- Surface user-facing errors with localized, actionable messages.

### SwiftUI Practices

- Business logic belongs in view models; keep Views declarative and light.
- Use `@State`, `@StateObject`, `@ObservedObject`, `@EnvironmentObject` appropriately; avoid accidental reference cycles.
- Leverage `EquatableView`/`@MainActor` and identifiable data for performant lists.

---

## üåê Localization & Accessibility

- **Locales:** `en-CA` primary; \`\` secondary. Keep strings in `Localizable.strings` and `String Catalogs`. Avoid hard-coded text.
- **A11y:** Provide labels, traits, and dynamic type support. Ensure sufficient contrast and VoiceOver navigation.

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

- **Levels:**
  - Unit tests for domain logic and view models.
  - Snapshot tests for UI (where stable and value-adding).
  - Integration tests around boundaries (network/persistence).
- **Style:** Arrange‚ÄìAct‚ÄìAssert; one logical assertion per test where possible.
- **Data:** Use builders/fixtures; avoid real network (use protocol-backed fakes or URLProtocol mocks).
- **Concurrency:** Test cancellation and timeouts deterministically.

---

## üîå Dependencies

- **SPM only** when possible. Pin versions reasonably; keep `Package.resolved` committed.
- Introduce libraries sparingly; prefer standard library + Foundation + SwiftUI first.

---

## üìù Documentation

- **Doc Comments:** Public APIs documented with `///`; include examples where helpful.
- **Design Notes:** Place durable design docs in `/Docs` and link them from source headers when relevant.
- **Change Logs:** Summarize notable changes in `CHANGELOG.md` per release.

---

## üîç Logging & Telemetry

- Use a thin logging facade (e.g., `os.Logger`) with categories per module.
- Log **events, not secrets**. Redact personal data.
- Ensure logs are opt-out where required by policy.

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

- Do not store secrets in source. Use Keychain or secure storage, and Xcode build settings for configuration.
- Validate inputs at boundaries; prefer non-escaping types for safe APIs.
- Treat analytics as untrusted input. Sanitize before use.

---

## üßπ swift-format / SwiftLint (Baseline Rules)

**swift-format:**

- Line length: 10000
- Indentation: 4 spaces
- Wrap arguments after first
- Wrap collections before first
- Strip unused args in closures
- Require explicit `self` in initializers

**SwiftLint (high-value subset):**

- `identifier_name` (lenient for common i, x, y in math/graphics)
- `file_length` (warn > 400, error > 800)
- `type_body_length` (warn > 200, error > 350)
- `function_body_length` (warn > 60, error > 120)
- `cyclomatic_complexity` (warn > 12)
- `force_cast` / `force_try` (error)
- `implicitly_unwrapped_optional` (error except DI edges)
- `todo` (warn; require ticket reference)

---

## üìÅ File Templates (One Entity per File)

Use these as starting points.

### Value Type

```swift
import Foundation

public struct <#Name#> {
    // MARK: - Stored Properties

    // MARK: - Init
    public init(/* deps */) {
    }
}

public extension <#Name#> {
    enum Kind { /* supporting enum */ }
}
```

### Actor (Shared Mutable State)

```swift
import Foundation

public actor <#Name#> {
    // MARK: - State

    // MARK: - Init
    public init(/* deps */) {}

    // MARK: - API
    public func doWork() async throws { }
}
```

### View Model (Swift Concurrency)

```swift
import Foundation

@MainActor
public final class <#Name#>ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    // MARK: - Inputs

    // MARK: - Outputs
    @Published public private(set) var state: State = .idle

    public enum State: Equatable {
        case idle
        case loading
        case loaded(Data)
        case failed(Error)
    }

    // MARK: - Dependencies

    public init(/* deps */) {}

    public func load() {
        Task { [weak self] in
            guard let self else { return }
            self.state = .loading
            do {
                let data = try await fetch()
                self.state = .loaded(data)
            } catch {
                self.state = .failed(error)
            }
        }
    }

    private func fetch() async throws -> Data { /* ... */ Data() }
}
```

### SwiftUI View (Composable)

```swift
import SwiftUI

public struct <#Name#>View: View {
    public init(/* deps */) {}

    public var body: some View {
        VStack { /* ... */ }
            .padding()
            .accessibilityElement(children: .contain)
    }
}
```

## üß≠ How I (Claude) Should Operate in This Repo

1. **Default Behavior**
   - Propose the **smallest coherent plan** first. If multiple approaches exist, list them (Pros/Cons) and pick one with a brief rationale.
   - Produce **minimal diffs**. Keep PRs focused; suggest follow-ups for larger refactors.
2. **When Editing Files**
   - Only modify files relevant to the task. Preserve public APIs unless the task includes a planned breaking change.
   - If a file contains multiple entities, propose a follow-up to split them (one entity per file) and outline the steps.
3. **When Adding Files**
   - Use the templates above. Include top-of-file doc comments explaining purpose and usage.
4. **When Writing Tests**
   - Name tests to read as specs, e.g., `test_fetchUser_emitsLoadedOnSuccess()`.
5. **When Something‚Äôs Unclear**
   - Ask up to **3** targeted questions with reasonable defaults to continue.

## üß≠ Decision Heuristics

- Prefer **clarity over cleverness**.
- Model invariants in types; eliminate invalid states.
- Keep I/O at the edges; pure core.
- Make illegal states unrepresentable; use `nonisolated` and `Sendable` correctly.
- Measure before micro-optimizing; use Instruments for real data.

---

## üìé Conventional Commits (Recommended)

- `feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `build:`
- Keep subjects imperative and ‚â§72 chars.
