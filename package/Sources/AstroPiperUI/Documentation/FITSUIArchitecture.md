## Status: Implemented
**Date**: 2025-01-05  
**Authors**: Tom (SwiftUI Architecture Specialist)  
**Reviewers**: AstroPiper Team

## Context

Phase 3 of AstroPiper requires FITS-specific UI enhancements to support professional astronomical imaging workflows. The existing ImageViewer handles standard image formats well, but lacks the specialized features required for scientific astronomical analysis:

### Requirements Addressed
- **Real-time coordinate tracking** with WCS transformations
- **Scientific metadata inspection** across multiple categories  
- **Pixel value analysis** with raw vs. calibrated modes
- **Region-based statistics** for quantitative analysis
- **Professional astronomical workflow** support
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (iOS/macOS/iPadOS)

### Constraints
- Must maintain clean MVVM architecture
- Must support @MainActor isolation for Swift Concurrency
- Must be testable with dependency injection
- Must handle large FITS files efficiently
- Must preserve dark mode for night vision

## Decision

We have implemented a layered FITS-aware UI architecture consisting of four main components:

### 1. FITSImageViewer - Enhanced View Container
**File**: `Sources/AstroPiper/Views/FITSImageViewer.swift`

**Purpose**: Main container view that orchestrates FITS-specific functionality while extending the base ImageViewer.

**Key Features**:
- Wraps existing ImageViewer for core zoom/pan functionality
- Manages overlay visibility states
- Handles cursor tracking for coordinate calculations
- Provides control toolbar for FITS-specific features
- Auto-detects FITS metadata and WCS capabilities

**Architecture Pattern**: Composition over inheritance - embeds ImageViewer rather than subclassing.

```swift
@MainActor
public struct FITSImageViewer: View {
    @State private var baseImageViewer: ImageViewer
    @State public var showMetadataOverlay: Bool = false
    @State public var showCoordinateOverlay: Bool = true
    @State public var showScientificControls: Bool = false
    
    // Composes multiple specialized overlays
}
```

### 2. CoordinateOverlay - Real-time Coordinate System
**File**: `Sources/AstroPiper/Views/CoordinateOverlay.swift`

**Purpose**: Provides real-time coordinate tracking, WCS transformations, and astronomical reference information.

**Key Features**:
- Pixel-to-world coordinate transformations via WCS
- Real-time cursor position tracking
- Orientation compass (North/East indicators)
- Field of view calculations and display
- Angular scale references with proper units
- Coordinate formatting (RA in HMS, Dec in DMS)

**Architecture Pattern**: Pure view with calculated properties - no stored state, reactive to cursor position.

```swift
@MainActor
public struct CoordinateOverlay: View {
    public let wcsInfo: WCSInfo?
    public let cursorPosition: CGPoint
    public let isCursorActive: Bool
    
    // Real-time coordinate calculations
    public func worldCoordinates(for point: CGPoint) -> (ra: Double?, dec: Double?)
}
```

### 3. MetadataInspector - Scientific Data Browser
**File**: `Sources/AstroPiper/Views/MetadataInspector.swift`

**Purpose**: Comprehensive FITS metadata inspection with tabbed interface for different data categories.

**Key Features**:
- **Observatory Tab**: Telescope, instrument, observer information
- **Exposure Tab**: Imaging parameters, temperature, gain, binning
- **WCS Tab**: Coordinate system details and validation
- **Headers Tab**: Complete FITS header browser with search/filter
- Clipboard integration for data copying
- WCS validation with scientific reasonableness checks

**Architecture Pattern**: Tab-based organization with computed properties for filtered data.

```swift
@MainActor
public struct MetadataInspector: View {
    public let metadata: FITSImageMetadata
    @State public var selectedTab: TabType = .observatory
    @State public var headerSearchText: String = ""
    
    public var filteredHeaders: [(key: String, value: String)]
    public var availableTabs: Set<TabType>
}
```

### 4. ScientificControls - Quantitative Analysis Tools
**File**: `Sources/AstroPiper/Views/ScientificControls.swift`

**Purpose**: Professional tools for quantitative image analysis and region-based statistics.

**Key Features**:
- Region selection and statistical analysis
- Raw vs. calibrated pixel value modes
- Real-time pixel value inspection at cursor
- Statistical calculations (mean, std dev, min/max, median, SNR)
- Data export capabilities (CSV/JSON)
- BZERO/BSCALE aware calculations

**Architecture Pattern**: Analysis-focused view with async statistical calculations.

```swift
@MainActor
public struct ScientificControls: View {
    public let image: any AstroImage
    @State public var showRawPixelValues: Bool = false
    @State private var regionStatistics: RegionStatistics?
    
    public func calculateRegionStatistics(region: PixelRegion) async throws -> RegionStatistics
}
```

### 5. FITSImageViewerViewModel - Business Logic Layer
**File**: `Sources/AstroPiper/ViewModels/FITSImageViewerViewModel.swift`

**Purpose**: Centralized business logic and state management following MVVM pattern with dependency injection.

**Key Features**:
- Manages all FITS-specific view state
- Coordinates between UI components
- Handles async image processing and analysis
- Dependency injection for testability
- Error handling and loading states
- Export functionality

**Architecture Pattern**: MVVM with protocol-based dependency injection.

```swift
@MainActor
public final class FITSImageViewerViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published public var viewState: ViewState = .idle
    @Published public var fitsMetadata: FITSImageMetadata?
    @Published public var currentWorldCoordinates: (ra: Double?, dec: Double?) = (nil, nil)
    
    private let coordinateCalculator: CoordinateCalculatorProtocol
    private let statisticsCalculator: StatisticsCalculatorProtocol
}
```

## Architectural Principles Applied

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each component has a focused responsibility:
- **FITSImageViewer**: UI orchestration and state management
- **CoordinateOverlay**: Coordinate system display and calculations  
- **MetadataInspector**: FITS header data presentation
- **ScientificControls**: Quantitative analysis tools
- **ViewModel**: Business logic and async operations

### 2. Composition Over Inheritance  
FITSImageViewer composes the base ImageViewer rather than inheriting from it, allowing us to extend functionality without breaking existing behavior.

### 3. Protocol-Oriented Design
Service protocols enable dependency injection and testing:
```swift
public protocol CoordinateCalculatorProtocol {
    func worldCoordinates(wcs: WCSInfo, pixelX: Double, pixelY: Double) -> (ra: Double?, dec: Double?)
}

public protocol StatisticsCalculatorProtocol {
    func calculateStatistics(for region: PixelRegion, in image: any AstroImage, useRawValues: Bool) async throws -> RegionStatistics
}
```

### 4. Reactive State Management
Uses `@Published` properties and `@State` for reactive UI updates with proper `@MainActor` isolation.

### 5. Testability First
All components support dependency injection and have comprehensive test coverage.

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Lazy Loading
- Coordinate calculations only occur when cursor is active
- Statistics calculations are on-demand only
- Large FITS headers are filtered reactively

### 2. Efficient Coordinate Transforms
- WCS calculations use optimized spherical trigonometry
- Coordinate caching for repeated calculations
- Validation is performed once during metadata loading

### 3. Memory Management
- Regional pixel data extraction avoids loading full images
- Overlay views use minimal state storage
- Proper cancellation handling for async operations

### 4. Responsive UI
- All blocking operations run on background tasks
- Loading states provide immediate feedback
- Progressive disclosure of detailed information

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
Each component has dedicated test files with comprehensive coverage:
- **FITSImageViewerTests**: UI component behavior
- **FITSImageViewerViewModelTests**: Business logic and state management
- Mock implementations for all external dependencies

### 2. Integration Tests
- Real FITS file processing with sample data
- Cross-platform compatibility validation
- Performance benchmarks for large files

### 3. Test-Driven Development
- Failing tests were written first for each component
- Mock services enable isolated testing
- Error scenarios are thoroughly covered

## Cross-Platform Support

### 1. macOS Specific Features
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Native scrollable zoom behavior
- Clipboard integration
- Menu bar actions

### 2. iOS/iPadOS Adaptations
- Touch-friendly controls and sizing
- Responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Swipe gestures for tab navigation
- Voice Over accessibility support

### 3. Shared Components
- All core FITS processing logic is platform-agnostic
- SwiftUI provides automatic platform adaptations
- Consistent visual design across platforms

## Future Extensibility

### 1. Additional Overlays
Architecture supports adding new overlay types:
- Annotation overlay for marking objects
- Measurement overlay for distance/angle tools
- Comparison overlay for blink analysis

### 2. Export Extensions
Export system can be extended for additional formats:
- FITS region files (DS9 format)
- Photometry tables
- Astrometric solutions

### 3. Analysis Tools
ScientificControls can be enhanced with:
- Photometry apertures
- Surface brightness profiles
- Histogram analysis
- Image calibration tools

## Migration Path

### 1. Backwards Compatibility
Existing ImageViewer usage remains unchanged. FITSImageViewer is additive functionality.

### 2. Incremental Adoption
Components can be adopted individually:
1. Start with FITSImageViewer for FITS-specific UI
2. Add CoordinateOverlay for WCS support
3. Include MetadataInspector for header browsing
4. Integrate ScientificControls for analysis

### 3. Custom Configurations
Each component accepts configuration parameters for customization without breaking changes.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Single Monolithic View
**Rejected**: Would violate single responsibility principle and make testing difficult.

### 2. Separate App for FITS
**Rejected**: Users expect unified experience for all astronomical image formats.

### 3. Third-party FITS Libraries
**Rejected**: Dependency on external libraries conflicts with Swift-first approach and adds complexity.

### 4. UIKit/AppKit Native Implementation
**Rejected**: SwiftUI provides better cross-platform support and cleaner state management.

## Risks and Mitigations

### 1. Performance with Large FITS Files
**Risk**: UI lag with multi-gigabyte FITS files  
**Mitigation**: Streaming data access, regional processing, background calculations

### 2. WCS Complexity
**Risk**: Astronomical coordinate systems are mathematically complex  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage with real sample files, validation warnings

### 3. Platform Differences
**Risk**: Different behavior across iOS/macOS  
**Mitigation**: Platform-specific testing, conditional compilation where needed

### 4. Scientific Accuracy
**Risk**: Incorrect astronomical calculations could mislead users  
**Mitigation**: Validation against established astronomy libraries, expert review

## Success Metrics
